## 03 Conclusions & Discussions

South Korea had been considered one of the safe countries from earthquakes before the 2016 Gyengju earthquake and the 2017 Pohang earthquake as the country’s severe earthquake in modern history of South Korea. These earthquakes caused many casualties and significant infrastructure damages.

In order to mitigate the effect of future earthquakes, we had a technical meeting to discuss on

- Bird eye's view of earthquake effects acting on objects in terms of Civil engineering analysis
- Retrofit methods for reinforced concrete buildings
- Earthquake alarming systems to notify residents in advance
